# Summer Movies

This week we're exploring "summer" movies: movies with "summer" in their title!

The data this week comes from the [Internet Movie Database](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/).
We don't have an article using exactly this dataset, but you might get inspiration from [IMDb's 2023 Summer Movie Guide](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls569932833/).
